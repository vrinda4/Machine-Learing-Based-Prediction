 Predicting the NCAA Basketball Tournament with ML
 # Goals
1. Build a model to predict game outcomes and the probabilities of each outcome
2. Train the model on historical data from past tournaments
3. Validate the model and evaluate performance by making predictions based on historical data from years withheld from the training set
4. Use the model to predict the outcomes of games in the 2017 tournament
5. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance based on prediction accuracy and log-loss on the games that actually occurred in the 2017 NCAA tournament
